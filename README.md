# speed-typing-game
A first small school assignment in React. I chose to develop a speed typing game where the user gets the result of every word that is correct in dictionary form. It may not be the most useful thing ever developed, but for me it was a great way to learn the basics of React.

## Requirements

- [x] It should be built in ReactJS

- [x] Should implement nice graphical user interface.

- [x] Can't use any third-party frameworks such as jQuery.

- [x] Can't contain any errors, warning or notices in the developer console.

- [x] Should consist of at least three react components.

- [x] Should include both stateless and stateful components and should use state and props.

- [x] Should include at least one API call. And its data should be presented.

- [x] Needs to be uploaded and presented on Netlify.
